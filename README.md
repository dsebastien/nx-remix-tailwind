# About
An example Nrwl NX workspace containing a Remix app configured to use Tailwind.
This uses the experimental [NX plugin for Remix](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nrwl/remix)

Took some inspiration from:
- Carlo Gino Catapang's article https://dev.to/codegino/styling-remix-using-tailwind-and-postcss-54b9 and https://github.com/codegino/playground for the Tailwind integration
- The Remix docs: https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/styling#tailwind-css
- The TailwindCSS docs: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/remix

Start using `npm run start:app`.
